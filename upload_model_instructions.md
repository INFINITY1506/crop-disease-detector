# Upload Your Trained Model

## After downloading from Google Colab:

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd /Users/pradyumansingh/Desktop/crop-disease-app-1755541742

# Copy your downloaded model files to models/ folder
# (Replace /path/to/downloads with your actual download path)
cp /path/to/downloads/model_savedmodel models/ -r
cp /path/to/downloads/model_new.keras models/
cp /path/to/downloads/model.h5 models/

# Add and commit the new model files
git add models/
git commit -m "Add real trained model from Google Colab"
git push origin main
```

## The app will automatically:
1. ✅ Detect your real trained model
2. ✅ Show "Real Trained Model Loaded" message
3. ✅ Give accurate predictions based on your training!

## Priority order:
1. `models/model_savedmodel` (best)
2. `models/model_new.keras` (good) 
3. `models/model.h5` (backup)
4. `models/model.keras` (old, likely incompatible)
